# QuestWeaver Product Overview

**Product Name:** QuestWeaver  
**Platform:** Android (API 26+)  
**Type:** Solo D&D-style RPG with AI Game Master

## What It Is

QuestWeaver is an offline-first Android app that delivers a single-player D&D experience. One human controls their PC while AI manages all NPCs, party members, narration, and rules adjudication. The app includes a simple tactical map for combat with grid-based movement, tokens, obstacles, and range overlays.

## Core Features

- **AI Game Master**: Handles scene narration, NPC dialogue, rules checks, and combat tactics
- **Tactical Combat**: Grid-based map with tokens, movement, attacks, spells, and conditions
- **Event-Sourced Persistence**: Full campaign state with replay capability and deterministic outcomes
- **Offline-First**: Core gameplay works without network; optional cloud sync for backups
- **SRD-Compatible Rules**: D&D 5e-style mechanics with homebrew support

## Key Principles

1. **Solo-Friendly**: Designed for one player with AI-controlled party members
2. **Deterministic**: Seeded RNG ensures reproducible outcomes
3. **Modular**: Swappable AI models, rules engines, and storage layers
4. **Privacy-First**: Local encryption, opt-in analytics, no data sharing
5. **Simple Tactical Map**: Focus on clarity over VTT-grade features
