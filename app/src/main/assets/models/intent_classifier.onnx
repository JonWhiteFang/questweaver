PLACEHOLDER_ONNX_MODEL

This is a placeholder file for the intent classification ONNX model.

To use the actual model:
1. Train or obtain a quantized INT8 ONNX model for intent classification
2. Model should accept input shape [1, 128] (batch_size=1, sequence_length=128) as Int32
3. Model should output shape [1, 12] (batch_size=1, num_classes=12) as Float32
4. Replace this file with the actual .onnx model file

Expected model specifications:
- Format: ONNX opset 13
- Input: Int32 tensor [1, 128] (tokenized text)
- Output: Float32 tensor [1, 12] (intent probabilities)
- Size: ~80MB (quantized INT8)
- Intents: ATTACK, MOVE, CAST_SPELL, USE_ITEM, DASH, DODGE, HELP, HIDE, DISENGAGE, READY, SEARCH, UNKNOWN

Until a real model is provided, the system will use keyword-based fallback classification.
